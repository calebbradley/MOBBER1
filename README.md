MOBBER1
=======

Mobber Project.


  This was my very first lay-out project based on a screen-shot. 
  
    Languages used for this project were HTML and CSS.
  
     Being my very first real project I learned an immense amount about how to organize a webpage and the thought process behind basic layout and design.
